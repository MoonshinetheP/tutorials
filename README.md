# tutorials
In this directory you can find tutorials for each of the programming languages/applications I am interested in. I make notes in the style of a lesson plan whilst I am learning, so that when I need to read it back, I remember more clearly what I learnt before. Feel free to use any of my notes, or suggest changes if you notice a mistake.
