    "We might be able to replicate the appearance of the above code in Word, making it more readable and easier to understand the individual elements of this code (note the different highlighting for functions, classes, comments, *etc.*). However, the Word programme is designed to make .doc files, which cannot be used to run Python scripts. We will need something that can save in a .py file extension.\n",

    "We can save Notepad files in the .py extension and execute them through the command prompt. However, if we make a mistake in our code, then Notepad won't detect it and we may spend forever looking for our bugs. Notepad doesn't allow us to easily structure our code or colour coordinate different elements of the code. As a result, it can be a little difficult to read code written in Notepad, especially as our code gets larger and more complicated.\n",

    "**Can we code directly in the Command Prompt?**\\\n",
    "We can use the `python` environment prompt in the Command Prompt (or in Powershell, which is a more powerful version of Command Prompt). In this environment, we can execute any code we would have in a .py file without requiring the file itself. Of course, this means we would not be able to save our Python scripts, which means we have to rewrite everything again each time we want to edit our code. Whilst we will use the Command Prompt at several points during this course, it is also possible to delete important folders from our computer if we are not careful, so it is also a good idea to avoid it as an editor for this reason alone."

    "There are a number of IDEs you can choose from, some paid and some free. So long as the IDE supports writing in the coding language you are using, which one you use comes down to personal preference more than anything else. Options include **Visual Studio**, **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, and many more. **VS Code** is probably the most popular IDE, due to its large community, its extensive tutorials and troubleshooting, its wide array of available extensions, and its support for many different programming languages. In this course, we will be using VS Code, but feel free to use whichever IDE you prefer - just be aware that not everything we discuss may be available on other IDEs. You can also find **text editors** which are more sophisticated than Notepad, but you will still need to run your scripts from a Command Prompt."

We will do this next, don't worry.\n",
