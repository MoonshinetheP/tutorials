    "Computer processing units (CPUs) often contain a number of processing cores\\\n",
    "The amount of things that can be done at the same time is limited by the number of cores\\\n",
    "Parallelism is when whe have multiple operations happening at the same time, each on a different core\\\n",
    "An analogue is cars driving along a road - if there is only one lane, then only one car can pass a point at a time, whilst a road with four lanes can accomodate up to four cars at a time\\\n",
    "The clock speed of a processor is how fast each core can perform an operation\\For example, a cloak speed of 2.6 GHz means 2.6 billion operations per second per core\\\n",
    "We are limited to one operation per time unit of the clock speed, but computers are performing many tasks at the same time. How does the core handle all the requests at once?\\\n",
    "A thread is a set of operations that needs to happen on a core\\\n",
    "If a core has been given more than one thread, it needs to decide how to switch from one task to another - this is called threading\\\n",
    "We can see how many threads there currently are by going to the Task manager and looking at the CPU stats of the performance tab\\\n",
    "When a thread can stop, it is called hanging\\\n",
    "Hanging frees up a core to allow other operations and threads to be worked on\\\n",
    "This is called concurrent programming - not in parallel, but in different timing sequences with the core switching between threads in the excecution chain\\\n",
    "Imagine one CPU core running a code in which we print the number 1, wait for 10 s, and then print the number 2\\\n",
    "What we will see is the 1 being printed, a pause of 10 s, and then the 2 being printed.\\\n",
    "If we move the print 2 command onto another thread, we will instead see 1 being printed, then 2 being printed, then a 10 s wait\\\n",
    "The core switches threads upon the wait command, because there is nothing that needs to be done during this time\\\n",
    "This is useful for example in server responses, because instead of waiting for the server response to continue the next line of commands, you can continue whilst you wait\n"
