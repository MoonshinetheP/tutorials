This means there are 10 numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) which are used to build all other numbers. If we separate each digit of a number into columns, we can represent the number in each column as the number times 10 to the power of the column number (starting from 0, right to left).  "

    "We say that computers use binary, but in reality there are no 1s and 0s floating around the computer. These values are represented by high and low voltages moving around the circuitry. In digital logic, the voltage value of 1 is 5 V and the value of 0 is 0 V. However, to allow for errors in the voltage we normally accept anything above 3 V as 1 and anything below 0.8 V as 0. Part of the reason we use a binary system is because accounting for varying levels of 'on' and 'off' can be challenging when compared to reading a simple 1 or 0. Another reason is that it allows us to perform logical operations on binary data, forming the basis of computing."
