Clicking the run button evaluates all the commands in order. You can change the outlook of the workspace so that variable answers are stored on right or under the variable. You can also click on a variable to highlight the answer in the workspace and vice versa. You can also break the script into sections, allowing ou to run a portion of code at a time (click run section)"
